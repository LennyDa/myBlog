Hi there, let me tell you a little bit about myself:)

I like to travel, take pictures, read books, play music and code!

I like to learn new things and try new technologies. 

When I create something new, I like to make sure it's not just working well but also looks good!
Personally, I like clean and minimal design (I think you can see it here:), that's focused on the story. 

One thing I've learned on my trips: it's amazing if you made it to the top of the mountain, but the way up is also meaningful - you always learn something about yourself and about the world around you.

Enjoy the way, enjoy life:)
