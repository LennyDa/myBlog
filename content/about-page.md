So... I decided to open a Blog! 

Why? I need a place where I can throw all of my ideas and have fun trying different things in this magical world of us, developers.

I'm also going to use some other skills and hobbies I have in order to make this place shine (bright like a diamond;)

Anyway.. the main reason I opened it is for coding and fun. So.. enjoy!
